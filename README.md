## Description

  

[scrumBoard](https://lindsayhoutz.github.io/scrumBoard/)

  This tool allows teams to create cards to visualize their tasks and projects. It also offers features like progress tracking, which help teams stay on top of their work and ensure that everyone is on the same page.

Keep track of your to-do list like a boss with this tool! It'll help you organize tasks, show you what's still up in the air, what you're wrestling with, what's in the works, and what you've already conquered. It's like having a personal assistant, minus the coffee runs and complaints about their workload.
  
**Why did we make this application?** 
Our application was developed to address the challenges of disorganized teams and unclear communication. By streamlining task management and enhancing transparency, we aim to improve productivity and foster a more collaborative work environment.
It was designed to provide a visual overview of claimed tasks and their development stages, ensuring transparency and effective task management. Additionally, it is accessible to future team members across different departments, regardless of their GitHub account status.
  
**Collaboration Methods**
- Regular video conferences for effective communication and collaboration.
- Collaborative coding sessions to foster idea sharing and problem-solving.
- Independent work to encourage individual creativity and focus.
- Continuous idea exchange and updates via Slack outside of scheduled meetings.

**Working Agreements**
-   Discuss ongoing tasks and identify any challenges or roadblocks.    
-   Share insights, offer constructive feedback, and provide guidance as needed.    
-   Assist team members with any required support or resources.    
-   Distribute tasks effectively among team members.    
-   Update the Google sheet to reflect task assignments and responsibilities.    
-   Commence work on assigned tasks.
  
**Team Workflow**
**Stand-ups:**
Regular team meetings to discuss progress, challenges, and completed tasks. This ensures that all team members are aligned and aware of the project's status.

**Teach-backs:**
Tavin conducted a session to walk the team through his code, explaining its functionality and implementation. This practice promotes knowledge sharing and learning among team members.

**Stuck Time:**
If a team member is stuck on a problem for more than an hour, they should reach out to the team through Slack for assistance. This ensures that issues are resolved promptly and team members receive the necessary support.

**Communication:**
Frequent and open communication is encouraged within the team. This helps in maintaining transparency, resolving issues quickly, and fostering a collaborative work environment.

Here is a demonstration of our scrumBoard application in action. Users can create notes, assign them to different statuses such as 'In Progress,' 'Struck,' 'Complete,' or 'Remove,' to effectively manage and prioritize tasks.

## Code Examples

**Buttons Code**
Have access to buttons that enable me to create new sticky notes and delete old ones. This functionality will allow me to efficiently manage and organize my tasks, ensuring that I can focus on the most important and relevant items.

**Bootstrap's Styling Code**
We utilized Bootstrap's official documentation to effectively integrate the framework into our codebase. Many of the features on our website are built using Bootstrap's pre-designed templates, which have greatly streamlined our development process.

**Media Queries Code**
  Here is an example of code utilizing media queries to ensure the application's responsiveness and optimal display on mobile devices.

**Drag and Drop Code**
Here is an initial code snippet demonstrating the implementation of drag-and-drop functionality, which unfortunately did not function correctly when we incorporated the columns and notes feature.

We utilized W3Schools' resources to develop a more efficient code that successfully integrated the drag-and-drop functionality with the styling and HTML elements.

**Local Storage Code**
We utilized local storage to retain note values and subsequently populate the notes on the page, ensuring data persistence across user sessions.

  ## Development
  **Concept Development**
The team solidified the idea through a series of brainstorming sessions where we discussed our vision for the application and identified the key features we wanted to incorporate. These discussions allowed us to refine our concept and create a clear roadmap for development.

**Developing Features**
User Story
**AS A Member** of a development team
**I WANT an application** that enables me to prioritize tasks at different levels
**SO THAT We** can effectively manage our work, adapt to changes, adjust our approach, improvise when necessary, and overcome challenges that arise during the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC).
**By using this application,** we aim to:
- Enhance our ability to manage and prioritize tasks based on their level of importance and urgency.
- Improve our team's flexibility and adaptability in responding to changes and unexpected challenges.
- Foster a culture of continuous improvement, allowing us to refine our processes and deliver high-quality software solutions.

**This application** will help us streamline our workflow, increase productivity, and ultimately deliver better software products.

We started with this wire frame then added each feature as we flushed out our user story. The User Story informed us of what elements to include in our Wireframe like the create button, delete buttons and the different columns for the sticky notes and features drag and drop, options of different color notes, etc.

## Learning Points
**Code Challenges Overcome**
1.  Resolution of Merge Conflicts:
    
2.  The initial implementation of the drag-and-drop functionality was not successful, necessitating a fresh start from the beginning.
    
3.  Successfully repopulated notes from local storage.
    
4.  Implemented color customization feature for dropdown notes.
